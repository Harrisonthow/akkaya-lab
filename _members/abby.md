My name is Abby Kraynak! Iâ€™m a third year undergraduate student at The Ohio State University studying Biology on a Pre-Medical pathway alongside a minor in Business. I am originally from Broadview Heights, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. Outside of being an undergraduate research assistant at Akkaya Laboratory on the T-Cell side, I am also the Co-Founder/President of Friendship Circle at The Ohio State University where I spend time building friendships with children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Additionally, I am the Marketing Chair for VAW Global Health Alliances and the Director of Primary Recruitment for Alpha Phi. This past summer I spent two weeks in Panama on a medical outreach internship in addition to working as a Registered Behavioral Technician at a therapy center for children with autism. Outside of academics, I enjoy spending time exercising, listening to music, and reading.
