I’m Anahat Dhillon. I am an undergraduate research assistant on the B-Cell side of the Akkaya Lab. I’m currently a sophomore majoring in neuroscience and minoring and nutrition. Besides the research, I am part of the Honors program, Pre-Med APAMSA, Neuroscience Ambassador program, and more. I love travelling, but my home is always in Cleveland, OH. I am also a big foodie, so I love trying new foods and cooking in my free time.
