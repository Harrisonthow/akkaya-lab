I'm Anahat Dhillon, I am an undergraduate research assistant on the B-Cell side of the Akkaya Lab. I'm currently a sophomore majoring in neuroscience and minoring and nutrition. Other than research I am part of the Honors program, Pre-Med APAMSA, Neuroscience Ambassador program, and more. I love traveling, but my home is always Cleveland, OH. I am also a big foodie so I love trying new foods and cooking in my free time.
