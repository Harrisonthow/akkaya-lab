Hi I am Annie, a third year undergrad at The Ohio State University majoring in biology and minoring in Health, Environment, Risk and Science Communication. I work as a research student assistant in the B-cell side of the Akkaya lab and as a PCNA at University Hospitals in Cleveland. I am also a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority, and within that have roles on both the conduct and philanthropy committees. I also volunteer with the Heart for the Unhoused program and am an organic chemistry mentor. In my free time I enjoy hot yoga and spending time with my friends.
