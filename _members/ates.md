Hi, my name is Ateş Kutay Tenekeci. I am a 5th year student at Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine. I am in my 3nd year of the MD-PhD program at our school. Currently, I am taking clinical rotation trainings and a biochemistry doctorate class. I am working at the B cell side of the Akkaya Lab. I like making coffee and listening music.
