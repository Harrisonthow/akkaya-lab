My name is Bayley McRitchie, and I am a research assistant here in the T cell side of the Akkaya Lab. I grew up in northeast Ohio in Medina county before going to The Ohio State University where I received my degree in Biochemistry in 2022. I am fascinated by the immune system, and hope to use all that Iâ€™ve learned in the Akkaya Lab as a physician one day. In my free time I love going on runs, exploring new hiking trails, and cooking.
