Esin Bayrali Ulker, MSc. completed her undergraduate education in biochemistry at Ege University. She received her MSc. in molecular medicine at Istanbul University. Between 2020 and 2022, she carried out studies in the immunogenetics laboratory as part of Turkey's Scientific and Technological Research Council during the COVID-19 pandemic. She is currently working on her doctoral thesis about immunometabolism with Dr Munir Akkaya in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology at the Ohio State University.

Besides questioning the world and researching, her biggest passion is nature. She investigates the sources of her questions from nature and is an animal lover. She received training in reading literary and philosophical texts and established discussion groups in university clubs with the pieces she wrote in this field. Being in nature, reading, and making sense of life are the most basic features that define her.
