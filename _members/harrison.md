Hi, I'm Harrison! I am a third-year undergrad at Ohio State studying both biochemistry and German. I am originally from Cruden Bay, Scotland and now live just outside of Houston, Texas. On campus, I work as a Resident Advisor at Park-Stradley Hall, as well as a research assistant on the B Cell side of the Akkaya Lab (I also designed this website!). I hope to take the skills and techniques I learn in my time at the Akkaya lab to prepare myself for graduate school. I'm also involved in several on-campus organisations such as the National Residence Hall Honorary where I serve as the Director of Member Retention, the Pharmacy Club, and the German Club. Outside of academics, I often pass the time by going on runs, rock climbing, and reading.
