Hi, I’m Harrison! I am a third-year undergrad at Ohio State studying both biochemistry and German. I am originally from Cruden Bay, Scotland and now live just outside Houston, Texas. On campus, I work as a Resident Advisor at Park-Stradley Hall and a research assistant on the B Cell side of the Akkaya Lab (I also designed this website!). I hope to take the skills and techniques I learn at the Akkaya lab to prepare for graduate school. I’m also involved in several on-campus organisations, such as the National Residence Hall Honorary, where I serve as the Director of Member Retention, the Pharmacy Club, and the German Club. Outside academics, I often pass the time by running, rock climbing, and reading.
