Hi! My name is Megan and I am a third-year undergrad student at OSU. My major is Biology and my minor is Political Science and I am pre-med! I am originally from northeast Ohio and I am an undergraduate research assistant on the B cell side of Akkaya Lab. I am also the secretary of an OSU club called MEDLIFE and I am a liaison for Heart for the Unhoused. I am also EMT certified and have a six month old puppy named Mia! In my free time I love to read, travel, go for walks with my dog, and spend time with friends!
