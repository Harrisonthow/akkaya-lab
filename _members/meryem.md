My name is Sohret Meryem Gokcek. I am from Izmir, Turkey. I recieved my BSc. in Molecular Biology and Genitics, and was a top student of the Faculty of Science and ranked second overall in my univeristy. During my bacherlors program, I designed a research project to elucidate the molecular mechanism of obesity. My project was supported by a national funder. For the past two years, I have been studying obesity from different perspectives. Currently, I am working as an research assistant under Dr. Munir Akkaya at the Ohio State University College of Medicine Department of Rheumatology and Immunology. My main focus is on how obestiy affects the immune response, specifically in terms of B-Cell function. I am also interested in combining wet lab research with in-silico approches, such as omics analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. Outside of my academic work, I have been in theatre for the past nine years.
