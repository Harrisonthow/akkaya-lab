I am Sohret Meryem Gokcek. I am from Izmir, Turkiye. I got my Bsc on Molecular Biology and Genetics as a top student of Faculty of Science and second ranked student in university. In my bachelors, I wrote a research project to enlighten molecular mechanism of obesity in neural cell lines and it was supported by national funder. For 2 years straight, I am working on obesity with different perspectives. Currently, I am working as a research assistant on guard of Assistant Professor Dr. Munir Akkaya at OSU Medicine Rheumatology & Immunology Department. I focus on how obesity affects immune response in terms of B cell function. Also, I have strong passion on combining wet lab research with in-silico approaches such as different kind of omics analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. Beside all academical stuff, I played theatre for 9 years along.
