Hi, Iâ€™m Sahitya and I am originally from Washington D.C! I am currently an undergraduate student at The Ohio State University studying Public Health and pursuing a medical track. I am a research assistant on the B cell side of Akkaya Lab. I also participate in other organizations and clubs on campus, such as the Taekwondo Club and Buckeye Tutor Team. My other hobbies include making artwork and going on walks around campus.
