Hey! I am Sanju Gudla. I am a high school senior at the Olentangy High School. I was born in Columbus, Ohio, and have lived here ever since. I work as a child care associate at Mount Carmel and intern on the T cell side of the Akkaya lab. I'm involved in various activities like the Be Wise Initiative, HOSA, and Science Olympiad at my school. Outside of school, I find myself reading, baking, and dancing.
