Hello everyone! I’m Srikruthi (Sri) Godavarthi, a senior at Olentangy High School. I hope to study Biomedical Sciences, Public Health, and Spanish in college. I currently work as a research assistant in the B-Cell division of the Akkaya Lab. I also conduct research at Nationwide Children’s in their Perinatal Research Center. I’m heavily involved in Speech and Debate, Science Olympiad, and mental health advocacy groups at school. I love to cook, read, and meet new people in my free time!
