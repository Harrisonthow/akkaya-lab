Hello everyone! I’m Srikruthi (Sri) Godavarthi and I’m a senior at Olentangy High School. I hope to study Biomedical Sciences, Public Health, and Spanish in college. I currently work as a research assisrant in the B-Cell division of the Akkaya Lab. I also conduct research at Nationwide Children’s in their Perinatal Research Center. At school, I’m heavily involved in Speech and Debate, Science Olympiad, and mental health advocacy groups. In my free time, I love to cook, read, and meet new people!
